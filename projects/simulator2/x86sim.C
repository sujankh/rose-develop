             "This tool simulates concrete execution of an executable specimen in an unsafe manner. Any system calls made by "
             "the specimen are passed along by the underlying operating system after possible translation by this tool. The "
             "tool emulates various services typically provided by the operating system, such as memory management, signal "
             "handling, and thread support.\n\n"

             "This tool is not intended to be a full-fledged virtual machine, but rather a dynamic analysis platform. "
             "The dynamic nature comes from ROSE's ability to \"execute\" an instruction in a concrete domain, and the "
             "tool's ability to simulate certain aspects of an operating system, including process and thread creation, "
             "signal delivery, memory management, and system call emulation. There may be other alternatives more "
             "suitable to your situation:"

             "@bullet{ROSE can analyze a natively running process.  It does so by attaching to the process as if it "
             "were a debugger and querying the process's state (memory and registers) from the operating system. This is "
             "much less complicated than trying to simulate execution by emulating substantial features of the operating "
             "system.}"

             "@bullet{ROSE has a built-in debugger. ROSE can execute a specimen natively within its own debugger, which "
             "includes the ability to set breakpoints for entire regions of memory (e.g., all addresses). This allows "
             "user-written tools to easily customize execution within the debugger. This can be combined with the previous "
             "bullet to analyze the program both dynamically and staticlly is and is significantly faster than "
             "simulating each instruction.}")
        .doc("Caveats", "z",
             "Speed of simulation is not a primary goal of this tool. ROSE is mostly a static analysis library "
             "whose capabilities happen to include the ability to write a concrete simulation tool.\n\n"

             "Specimen memory is managed in a container within the simulating ROSE process. Therefore operations like "
             "interprocess communication via shared memory will probably never work.  This limitation may also include "
             "intra-process communication with shared memory mapped at two different addresses, and other \"tricks\" that "
             "specimens sometimes do with their memory maps.\n\n"

             "The specimen process and threads are simulated inside this tool's process and threads. Certain operations that "
             "modify process and thread properties will end up modifying the tools process and threads. For instance, reading "
             "from the Linux \"/proc/@v{n}\" filesystem will return information about the simulator tool rather than "
             "the specimen being simulated. Sending a signal to a process or thread will cause the tool to forward the "
             "signal to the simulated process or thread only if this behavior is enabled at runtime.");
